<h2 id="SOURCES_OF_AUTHORITY">SOURCES OF AUTHORITY.</h2>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P1">1.</a></span> It is to be regretted that every publishing-house
does not start on the principle that
a thorough system of doing things right should
precede the turning out of printed matter; but
the press of business is so great, the demands
for ‘rush work’ are so many, that system comes
last, if at all. Managers are busy with the
cash account and the pay-roll, for which reason
a great deal is left to chance.</p>

<p>Thus it falls that the negligence, incompetence,
or preoccupation of printing-office managers
makes good systems of typography the
exception rather than the rule. It is a reflection
on the art preservative that the slipshod
methods and unscholarly composition of the
daily newspaper type often corrupt the pages
of trade-and class-publications, as well as
of magazines and books. See paragraph <a href="#P45">45</a> of
this book for an explanation of the use of
hyphens in the foregoing sentence. See paragraph
<a href="#P68">68</a> for the use of single quote-marks
herein.</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_6" title="6"></a>

<p>The hurried work of newspapermen may be
partly excused on the ground of haste, yet in
another sense it requires no more time to do a
thing the right way than to do it the wrong
way.</p>

<p>Printing-houses that pretend to turn out
careful work, such as publishing books and
periodicals, should follow some model of unquestioned
authority; but as proper exemplars
are not often at hand, the daily newspaper,
being omnipresent, is taken for a pattern.</p>

<p>The purpose of this handbook is to furnish a
guide based on the scholarship and technical
knowledge of some of the world’s greatest
authors and printers. As blunders and inconsistencies
creep into print everywhere, even
when special care is taken to avoid them, the
author expects this very work to be an example
of the mistakes it warns others to avoid. Such
shortcomings as here appear, however, should
serve to emphasize the need of great pains by
all who write and print.</p>

<p>Some years ago it fell to the author to harmonize
the style-codes of three printing-houses
that were doing work for him. In seeking a
model of accuracy and typographical neatness
the system expounded by Theodore Low De
Vinne, used by the <cite>Century Magazine</cite> and the
Century Company, was chosen.</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_7" title="7"></a>

<p>It was discovered that there never has been
any formal style-code in use by the De Vinne-Century
printers. They have learned the style
by studying De Vinne’s <cite>Correct Composition</cite>
and like works of his on typography. Office
experience teaches printers the written and unwritten
laws of the De Vinne code.</p>

<p>The method of the Century printers has been
largely the method of the author of this
manual. By correspondence with Mr. De
Vinne, by studying his books, and by the practical
application of his rules to the work of
many offices the writer has come to know his
methods, which are believed to be the simplest
and most scholarly in use in the United States
to-day. More than eighty per cent of the rules
herein expounded are codified from the works
of De Vinne, or gleaned from Teall and similar
sources of indisputable authority. The
work of the Chicago Proofreaders’ Association
has been found helpful in the compounding of
words.</p>

<p>System is as necessary in a printing-house as
in a bank, and classification and obedience to
the law of the office are absolutely essential
to the production of correct composition. Since
many editors and patrons, authors and others
are usually either careless or untrained in the
art of preparing copy, the printer must be extremely<a class="pagenum" id="Page_8" title="8"></a>
painstaking and methodic, or his work
will be censured, and he will be blamed for
every fault that shows itself in ‘cold type.’
The owners of newspapers printed at other
men’s offices are especially unreasonable when
mistakes occur. No matter how careless such
customers are with their work, they expect
the printer to be infallible. Every publisher
of wide experience will corroborate this statement.
The skilful writer expects reasonable
accuracy, the ignoramus wants printers to be
Macaulays and mind-readers as well.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P2">2.</a> Why Style-codes are Necessary.</span> Style-codes
are necessary because much of the copy
that is presented to printers is neither written
nor edited with reference to accuracy, consistency,
or the rules of orderly typography. Indeed
much copy is not edited at all; it reaches
the case or the machine with its original crudities
thick upon it, and if blunders are discovered
by the public the slovenly authors defend
themselves by charging them to ‘errors of the
types,’ or blunders of the printers. On account
of the general carelessness of writers,
style-codes are necessary; they enable printers
and proofreaders to hold writers within reasonable
bounds. If all things were written just
as they should be printed, style-codes would be
useless.</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_9" title="9"></a>

<p><span class="section"><a id="P3">3.</a> Edited Manuscripts Save Money.</span> Just
as short words and short, simple sentences save
the time and energy required to gather the
meaning that would be clouded by the use of
long, involved sentences, so clearly written and
accurately prepared manuscripts save time,
energy, and money in the printing-office.</p>

<p>Typewritten copy is almost a necessity in
this busy age, but whether penned or typed,
manuscripts should be consistent in style, and
above all readily legible. Fast typesetting machines
should not be made slow and expensive
by the carelessness and indistinct manuscripts
of editors and other writers for the press.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P4">4.</a> Uniformity is Essential to Success.</span> Uniformity
in the method of using capital letters,
compound words, punctuation marks, etc., is
essential where any care is taken with printed
matter. It is astonishing that many editors,
reporters, ministers, lawyers, and others who
write for publication are not only ignorant of
typographical niceties, but of fundamentals as
well. Going further, it may be said that many
printing-houses are conducted in a haphazard
way, as if uniformity and accuracy were luxuries
beyond price. Even under the best system,
contradictions and other errors are certain
to abound. The best that can be expected is
to reduce blunders to the minimum.</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_10" title="10"></a>

<p><span class="section"><a id="P5">5.</a> Passing the Blame to Printers.</span> Many
writers pass the responsibility and the blame
to printers. This is a slovenly and unreasonable
course. Printers do not agree, some are
incompetent, all are busy with other details
than editing copy, and it is not the duty of
printers to correct the blunders of writers.
Again, a printer may see but a fraction of
a given manuscript, and may not know, unless
there is an office style-card, what system is the
author’s desire. A style-card will show printers
the way out of many dark places, and will
overcome many of the obstacles presented
by the copy of untrained editors and writers.
In well-arranged offices, however, the compositor’s
right to make changes is a limited one.</p>

<p>It is the duty of typographers to follow copy
unless there is a clear inadvertence, such as
going <strong>too</strong> town instead of <strong>to</strong> town, for example.
Writers should understand that printers,
though often highly competent to write or edit
manuscripts better than those who present
them as copy, are too busy at the case or the
machine to stop and edit copy, form a style-code,
consult dictionaries, verify quotations,
harmonize discrepancies, and prevent the
blunders of writers in general. If nobody
edits copy, one of two things happens&mdash;the
blunders are put into type for the public eye,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_11" title="11"></a>
or they are corrected by the proofreader. The
former course destroys the printer’s reputation,
the latter adds to the cost of work.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P6">6.</a> Making Copy is an Art.</span> The world’s
universities do not teach how to prepare copy
for printers. Often college men are not only
poor writers of English, but they are as careless
of the niceties of typography as are printers
in most houses, editors of some publications,
ministers, school-teachers, reporters, and
public officers. In most manuscripts inconsistencies
abound. Numbers, for example, should
be spelled out, or written in arabic or in roman
numerals, yet the three methods are sometimes
seen on one page of copy.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P7">7.</a> Uniform Methods Throughout.</span> Abbreviations,
the use of italic, of smaller bodies
of types, of varying measures, of bold-face,
light-faced antique, and like typographical
methods for indicating headings, cut-in notes,
emphatic words, etc., should be under some
definite and sensible plan.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P8">8.</a> Points for Writers.</span> Paper for linotype
operators as well as that for hand-compositors
should be about the size of commercial note,
and the writing should run the long way of
the page, the reason being that sheets of the
commercial note size fit into the machine ‘copy-holder’
very neatly. Good margins should be<a class="pagenum" id="Page_12" title="12"></a>
left at the top and sides, this for side-notes
and catch-lines for headings. Names of persons,
etc., should be ‘printed out’ carefully in
manuscripts, and interlineations should be
avoided. Blind hands have always caused infinite
trouble in printing-houses. (Consult
‘blind’ in the <cite>Standard Dictionary</cite>.)</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P9">9.</a> Style-codes Should be Mastered.</span> Those
in authority in publishing-houses and elsewhere
should compel reporters, editors, printers,
proofreaders, and others whose duty it is
to know <strong>style</strong> to master the office code. In
many instances the carelessness of writers adds
to the cost of production in every other department
of publishing. Strangely, however,
many writers assume offhand that anybody
can capitalize words correctly and uniformly.
Such writers jump to conclusions in the most
reckless way imaginable. Their methods and
definitions are no more correct than were the
definitions given by a band of amateur scientists
who described a crab in answer to the
great Cuvier’s question. They said a crab was
a small, red fish that walks backward. “A perfect
definition,” said Cuvier, “except that the
crab is not a fish, is not red, and does not walk
backward.”</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P10">10.</a> Office Dictionary Should Govern.</span> One
dictionary should be selected as the sovereign<a class="pagenum" id="Page_13" title="13"></a>
guide in every printing-house. If some things
in the chosen dictionary seem wrong there
should be a list or card of variations from authority.
For many reasons the author of this
little book prefers the <cite>Standard Dictionary</cite> to
all others. It seems to have, among other
things, the most consistent and thorough method
of compounding words. Its spellings are the
simplest, its pronunciations the most rational.
The incomparable work of F. Horace Teall
shines in the department that deals with the
important subject of compounding English
words. Teall’s <cite>English Compound Words and
Phrases</cite> should be before every editor. As elsewhere
explained, his system is a little behind
the times, owing to a recent movement to
solidify words. See paragraph <a href="#P41">41</a>.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P11">11.</a> What Printers Should Edit.</span> There is
a class of matter which printers should edit
as they proceed in their work, and this they
should do without delay or risk of exceeding
authority. Reprint should be made to conform
to the office style. Often editors have
ample time to read clippings with sufficient
care for acceptance, but without time or means
to make such excerpts conform to the governing
code. Owing to lack of marginal space
and space between printed lines, there is no
room for certain emendations, the changing of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_14" title="14"></a>
compounds, and the rearrangement of capitals.
For these reasons most reprint reaches the
printer as it originally appeared in the ‘exchange’
from which it was clipped.</p>

<p>Even if an editor should take pains to
change the style of reprint the result would
be an unsatisfactory net-work of interlineations,
carets, transpositions, rings, and other
marks&mdash;in short, it would be bad copy. Some
editors make it a rule to quote the general style
of the clipping, holding that the style of the
clipping is as much a part of the author’s personality
as are his words and sentences. Unfortunately
there are usually so many contradictions
and inaccuracies, so many evidences
of <em>no style whatever</em>, that it is not a sensible
plan to follow reprint copy. The best system is
for the compositor to follow the code of his
office, and the code should be so well known to
him that to follow it would be a pleasure.</p>

<p>In many small offices, where copy-readers or
copy-editors are not employed, a knowledge of
the style-code by printers and proofreaders is
of vital importance. It has been computed by
a committee of printers of wide experience
that a style-code will save from three to five per
cent of the cost of composition. In offices conducted
along the lines of chaos the waste of
time is great.</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_15" title="15"></a>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P12">12.</a> Authors are the Supreme Authority.</span>
There is no doubt that every author has the
right to dictate what shall be the typographical
form of his work, but no self-respecting publisher’s
imprint or hall-mark ever appears on
the pages of slovenly work. Even the author
who demands his own way should be shown
his inconsistencies and slacknesses, if they
exist. The productions of some authors, who
insist that copy be followed by the printer,
betray lack of system before the work has
reached the end of a galley; but if a writer
urges that his faults be put in type his orders
should be followed. Instructions are often
obeyed, greatly to the amusement of everybody
in the office, including the battery boy and the
devil.</p>




<h2 id="ABBREVIATIONS_IN_GENERAL">ABBREVIATIONS IN GENERAL.</h2>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P13">13.</a></span> <strong>Anno Domini</strong> should be printed with
small capitals when abbreviated as <span class="all-small-caps">A.&nbsp;D.</span></p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P14">14.</a> Apostrophes for Plural of Letters
Wrong.</span> De Vinne aptly says on page 285
of <cite>Correct Composition</cite> that the apostrophe is
not proper to express plurality. Its use in
print for this purpose is the repetition of an
indefensible colloquialism, even though the dictionaries
record the form. Letters should be
spelled as follows; aes, bees, cees, dees, ees, efs,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_16" title="16"></a>
gees, aitches, ies, jays, kays, els, ems, ens, oes,
pees, ques, ars, esses, tees, ues, vees, ws or
dubleyuz, exes, wyes, zees. With the exception
of esses this is the form given by the
<cite>Standard Dictionary</cite>.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P15">15.</a> Apostrophe to be Omitted.</span> Mida’s
<cite>Criterion</cite> and Dean’s Landing need the apostrophe
as a sign of possession, but when referred
to as <cite>Midas</cite> and Deans, the apostrophe
is useless, and should be omitted. Harper’s
Ferry, but only Harpers when used in the curtailed
form for the Ferry, meaning Harper’s
Ferry. See De Vinne’s <cite>Correct Composition</cite>,
page 284. Consult paragraph <a href="#P68">68</a> of this book.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P16">16.</a> Apostrophe in Possessives.</span> Do not
omit the apostrophe in such names as James’s,
Banks’s, and Williams’s in possessive use. It
is a slovenly newspaper custom to omit apostrophes,
except when the sound of a second
ess makes a disagreeable hissing. Whenever
the second ess is distinctly pronounced it
should be inserted after the apostrophe. De
Vinne, Teall, Bain, Alford, Moon, and others
are firm in demanding the ess and the apostrophe
whenever the sound of the second ess is
given in speech. Bain says: “We say St.
James’s and St. Giles’s, Burns’s, and Douglas’s.”
This is also the style of such magazines
as the <cite>Century</cite>. See paragraphs <a href="#P15">15</a> and <a href="#P68">68</a>.</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_17" title="17"></a>

<p><span class="section"><a id="P17">17.</a> Arabic Numbers.</span> Books should be disfigured
as little as possible by arabic numerals
in the text. Numbers thus set are always dry
and forbidding in appearance. See paragraphs
<a href="#P19">19</a>, <a href="#P24">24</a>, and <a href="#P27_16">Words</a>, under paragraph 27, division
(16).</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P18">18.</a> A.&nbsp;M., etc.</span> Capital and small capital
letters are not needed in abbreviating time,
as a.&nbsp;m. and p.&nbsp;m. for ante meridiem and post
meridiem. It is best to spell out <strong>six o’clock</strong>,
etc. A.&nbsp;M. means master of arts and anno
mundi. P.&nbsp;M. means postmaster. If <em>time</em> is
meant, confusion sometimes arises. De Vinne
uses the period, and says the colon is an ignorant
substitution in this sense: <strong>2.30</strong> p.&nbsp;m. and
<strong>1.45</strong> a.&nbsp;m., not <strong>2:30</strong>, or <strong>1:45</strong>. See De Vinne’s
<cite>Correct Composition</cite>, page 82.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P19">19.</a> Ages of Persons.</span> Spell out the ages of
persons. John Jones is not <strong>aged</strong> twenty-one
years. He is twenty-one years <strong>of age</strong>, or twenty-one
years old&mdash;not an <strong>aged</strong> person. The last
use of <strong>aged</strong> is proper.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P20">20.</a> Books.</span> See paragraphs <a href="#P36">36</a>, <a href="#P52">52</a>; also see
division <a href="#P27_12">twelve</a> under paragraph 27.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P21">21.</a> Co. and Company.</span> Co. should be set
in capitals (<strong>CO.</strong>) when the firm name is in
capitals. The name JOHN BROWN’S Co. is
unsightly. Unless <strong>Co.</strong> is the style of the company,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_18" title="18"></a>
or incorporation, spell out the word. In
Co’s no period is needed after the <strong>o</strong>. De
Vinne’s <cite>Correct Composition</cite>, page 291.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P22">22.</a> Credits.</span> See paragraph <a href="#P52">52</a>. Credits at
the end of matter are best set in italic lower-case,
without any em dash to connect the credit
with the quotation. See De Vinne’s <cite>Correct
Composition</cite>, page 150.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P23">23.</a> Dates.</span> When the numeral precedes
the name of the month it may be written as
the <strong>28th</strong> of November, but when the numeral
follows, it should be November <strong>28</strong>. In <strong>2d</strong>, <strong>3d</strong>,
and like abbreviations, there is no need of <strong>n</strong>,
as in <strong>2nd</strong>.</p>

<p><b>Years.</b> Two consecutive years should be run
thus: During 1897-98, and not 1897-8. It is
proper to say the heroes of ’49. See paragraph
<a href="#P24">24</a>.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P24">24.</a> Figures.</span> Commas are not needed in
four figures, as: 1897, 5798. The comma should
not be inserted between figures expressive of
dates, as in June, 1898.</p>

<p>Numbers of infrequent occurrence should
be spelled out rather than put in roman
numerals. The engine weighed five thousand
tons, there were fifty-two gallons in the barrel,
there were seventeen thousand men in the
regiments. See paragraph <a href="#P17">17</a>.</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_19" title="19"></a>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P25">25.</a> Hours.</span> Print 11.30 a.&nbsp;m., and not 11:30
a.&nbsp;m. Use the period rather than the colon.
See paragraph <a href="#P18">18</a>.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P26"></a>26. Month, etc.</span> Month, inst., prox., and
ult., often abbreviated in letters, are improper
in all first-class work. Spell out the name of

<p><a id="P27_1">(1)</a> <b>e.&nbsp;g.</b> for exempli gratia, i.&nbsp;e. for id est,
q.&nbsp;v. for quod vide, viz. for videlicet or to wit,
etc. for et cetera, are barely tolerated in good
work and are discarded by many houses. If
authors will use such symbols they should spell
them out. Italic is not needed in these examples.
See De Vinne’s <cite>Correct Composition</cite>,
page 41.</p>

<p><a id="P27_2">(2)</a> <b>Dep’t</b>, treas., sec., gov’t, and similar
abbreviations are not permissible.</p>

<p><a id="P27_3">(3)</a> <b>Do</b> not use Xmas and Xtns for
Christmas and Christians.</p>

<p><a id="P27_4">(4)</a> <b>MS. and MSS.</b> MS. for manuscript
and MSS. for manuscripts. There should be
no period after the <strong>M</strong>.</p>

<p><a id="P27_5">(5)</a> <b>New York.</b> Do not use N.&nbsp;Y. when
you refer to New York City.</p>

<p><a id="P27_6">(6)</a> <b>Towns and Cities.</b> Do not abbreviate<a class="pagenum" id="Page_20" title="20"></a>
the names of towns and cities, and avoid abbreviation
of the names of states, except when they
follow town and city names. See paragraph <a href="#P29">29</a>.</p>

<p><a id="P27_7">(7)</a> <b>Titles.</b> It is a proper and decorous
system to spell out doctor, professor, general,
colonel, captain, major, and like titles. Good
book and magazine work oppose abbreviations
of such titles. Mr., Mrs., Jr., Sr., are allowed
as here written.</p>

<p><a id="P27_8">(8)</a> <b>To wit</b> should not be compounded.</p>

<p><a id="P27_9">(9)</a> <b>Spell out</b> fort, mount, point, port,
saint, etc. in every use.</p>

<p><a id="P27_10">(10)</a> <b>Parentheses.</b> Inclose the names of
states in parentheses when used in the following
way: The Albany (N.&nbsp;Y.) Law School; the
Milpitas (Cal.) <cite>Gazette</cite>. See paragraph <a href="#P29">29</a>.</p>

<p><a id="P27_11">(11)</a> <b>Pet Names.</b> Bill, Bob, Jim, Tom,
Joe, etc., are not abbreviations, and therefore
they need no period after the last letter.</p>

<p><a id="P27_12">(12)</a> <b>Quarto</b>, octavo, twelvemo, thirty-twomo,
etc., are best, but 4to, 8vo, and
<a id="TN_1">12mo</a> may be used, if they do not begin a
sentence.</p>

<p><a id="P27_13">(13)</a> <b>Streets.</b> The numerical names of
streets should be spelled out, as Fifteenth
Street, Twenty-second Street.</p>

<p><a id="P27_14">(14)</a> <b>Time.</b> See paragraph <a href="#P18">18</a>. Spell out<a class="pagenum" id="Page_21" title="21"></a>
the names of days of the week, as well as names
of months.</p>

<p><a id="P27_15">(15)</a> <b>Titles.</b> If John Jones has many
titles following his name, it is best to set them
in small capitals, as: <span class="all-small-caps">M.&nbsp;D.</span>, <span class="all-small-caps">F.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;S.</span>, <span class="all-small-caps">PH.&nbsp;D.</span>, <span class="all-small-caps">K.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;B.</span>
To set all in capitals is to give the name too
little prominence. One or two titles may be
set in capitals, but when there are three or
four, use small capitals.</p>

<p><a id="P27_16">(16)</a> <b>Words.</b> Words are preferred in
legal documents, as: Jean must appear in
court on the tenth of August, in the year of
our Lord one thousand nine hundred and six.</p>

<p><a id="P27_17">(17)</a> <b>PS.</b> PS. (for postscript or postscriptum)
without a period or space between
the letters. See MS., number (<a href="#P27_4">4</a>), paragraph
27.</p>

<p><a id="P27_18"></a>(18) <b>Commas Essential.</b> Commas are essential
in certain cases where they are often
omitted. Many printers seem to think it is
treason to put a comma before <strong>and</strong> in a series
of three words, and the Chicago Proofreaders’
Association omits commas in such instances.
The system is slovenly, however. De Vinne
properly expounds the rule. On page 253 of
<cite>Correct Composition</cite> he says: “The comma is
needed when the simplicity and directness of
a sentence are broken by the addition or repetition
of nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs<a class="pagenum" id="Page_22" title="22"></a>
that do not qualify the words that directly
follow.” He cites this example: “Ulysses was
wise, eloquent, cautious, and intrepid.” Note
the comma after <strong>cautious</strong>. Use the comma
without hesitation when the qualifying words
are more than two in number; as, the bay was
calm, beautiful, and clear as crystal. The comma
is sometimes erroneously omitted before the
conjunction in such cases as: Jean, Lucinda
and Alice have departed. There is no person
whose name is Lucinda and Alice. Again, the
impression may be made, by the omission of
the comma, that Lucinda and Alice went together,
and not with Jean.</p>

<p>Another point to be remembered is that
when the words are not in pairs, the comma
must be used, even if <strong>or</strong> frequently intervenes.
<cite>Correct Composition</cite>, page 254. When the words
are in pairs, connected by the word <strong>and</strong>, or disconnected
by the word <strong>or</strong>, the comma is needed
only at the end of each pair. <cite>De Vinne.</cite></p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P28">28.</a> Names.</span> Never abbreviate Jas., Jos.,
Thos., Geo., Wm., Theo., Chas., and other
Christian names. The decorous system is to
spell the names in full, except when following
exact signatures in legal documents and other
formal matter.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P29">29.</a> Names of States.</span> Names of states following
names of towns, except the names of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_23" title="23"></a>

<h2 id="CAPITAL_LETTERS_IN_GENERAL_33">33. CAPITAL LETTERS IN GENERAL.</h2>

Friday.</p>

<p>Almighty and like terms in lieu of God.</p>

<p>arctic ivory and all similar mercantile uses of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_25" title="25"></a>
such words as arctic in that sense. Even
titanic and herculean, in some uses.</p>

<p>algebra, botany and all sciences. See <a href="#Sciences">sciences</a>.</p>

<p><a id="association">association</a>, church, companies, political, and
similar names are written in small letters,
thus: trustee, councilman, supervisor, congressman,
director, secretary, president, governor,
superintendent, etc., unless the title
precedes a surname, in which case it is capitalized
as a title. If a title selected may be
applied to two or more persons use the small
letter, not the capital. Abbreviated expressions
take the capital letter as an initial, as:
<strong>the</strong> Union, <strong>the</strong> Club, <strong>the</strong> Church, <strong>the</strong> Senate,
<strong>the</strong> Company, <strong>the</strong> Chamber, <strong>the</strong> State, <strong>the</strong>
Nation, when such shortened expressions are
clearly used in place of the full name of the
body in question. The Union, if you mean
of states, or if you mean a certain typographical
union.</p>


<div class="title">B</div>

<p>Bank Holiday, because this is its proper name
as much as Wednesday is the name of a day.</p>

<p>the Board of Education, meaning a special one.</p>

<p>the County, meaning one in particular; in lieu
of full name.</p>

<p>a <a id="county">county</a>&mdash;any one.</p>

<p><a id="Counties">Counties</a>: Holt County is the name of the
political division or corporation, and when
<strong>the County</strong> is used as a shorter expression,
it is clearly a synonym for the full name.</p>

<p>the Congress of the United States, or Congress,
the Legislature.</p>

<p>the Congressman, meaning a special one. Several
congressmen and senators were there.
In this sense the nouns are common.</p>

<p><strong>Congressman</strong> illustrates De Vinne’s rule that
a title not a synonym for a specified person
(one only) should not begin with a capital.
See <a href="#association">Association</a>.</p>

<p>Centuries take a lower-case letter: fifteenth
century, nineteenth, twentieth, etc. This is
an exception to the rule concerning historical
epochs, but custom has made it proper.</p>

<p>a club, meaning any.</p>

<p>the Club, meaning the Century Club.</p>

<p>Columbia College, Stanford University, etc.</p>

<p>the Constitution of the United States, of any
particular state or society.</p>

<p>Devil, if John Milton’s is meant, also Satan,
Beelzebub.</p>

<p><a id="Definite_Titles">Definite Titles</a>. When definite titles or names
are shortened, like the Senate, the Club, etc.,
meaning a particular senate or club, use
capitals. Likewise where <strong>the</strong> State or <strong>the</strong>
Government means one in particular, as following
a reference to California, capitals
should be used. The Union, <strong>the</strong> Nation, etc.,
follow the same rule.</p>


<div class="title">E</div>

<p>the East, meaning an undefined geographical
section.</p>

<p>an east wind blew, however, meaning mere direction.</p>

<p>the Ex-president.</p>

<p>an ex-president, ex-mayor, ex-governor, etc.
When capitalized, the first letter of the compound
takes the capital, as: Ex-president
Cleveland. Many good writers prefer the expression
<em>former</em> president, etc.</p>

<p>Erie Canal.</p>

<p>the earth. Though the name of a definite planet,
this word is not capitalized. It is a clear
exception to the rule. The sun and the moon
usually go in lower-case.</p>

<p>the Flood of the Bible.</p>

<p>Fourth of July.</p>

and all geographical names used as proper
nouns go up; but nouns used to specify merchandise
go down, as: arctic ivory, india ink,
russia leather, morocco, turkey red, port

connection or literal sense of the name there
is no need of capitals. Consult De Vinne’s

the terms treasurer, secretary of state, etc.
If they precede the name of one person (not
of two or more) they take the capital initial.
If they follow a name or are preceded by <strong>the
indefinite article a</strong>, they need no capital.
The name of the office is never written with a
capital in this sense: He ran for the office of
justice of the peace, president, governor,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_34" title="34"></a>

Adjectives of the same, same rule.</p>

<p>Personification: Anything may be personified,
and all personified words should be capitalized,
as: The spirit of Fire; the voice of
Crime; the call of Duty; the ghost of Want.</p>

<p>Pronouns standing for Deity go thus: his wisdom;
him we fear; thou God; thy Word;
thee we adore. This is Biblical use. Capitalizing
was an error of hymn-books of the
long ago.</p>

<p><span class="section"><a id="P34">34.</a> Illustrations of the Code.</span> The following
sentences illustrate the rules herein expounded.
See section <a href="#P49">49</a>:</p>

<p>Saloon-keepers of the Reservation are in
session at the Log Cabin Saloon in this City,
and Government officials of Federal and State
power will be asked to do nothing until the
Supreme Court passes on the decisions of other
courts. If no satisfaction is obtained, the State
will be asked to refund sums expended in the
two Kansas Citys&mdash;Kansas City, Mo., and
Kansas City, Kan. Notice that <em>the two Kansas
cities</em> would convey the idea of two cities in
Kansas, and <em>the two Kansas Cities</em> would not
be an improvement.</p>

<div class="title">A NIGHT OF HORRORS.</div>

<p>It was Labor Day, but there was a celebration
equal to that of the Fourth of July.
No pagan holiday ever surpassed some of the
heathenish performances there enacted. According
to the New York Herald Ex-president
Cleveland was there, accompanied by Colonel
Hay, secretary of state. The President of the
United States was there, and various ex-presidents’
memories were honored. There were
senators, assemblymen, judges of the Supreme
Court of the United States, and judges from
other supreme courts in the throng&mdash;but not<a class="pagenum" id="Page_39" title="39"></a>
one from the Supreme Court of the state of
Georgia, or from New York State. David
Bennett Hill wore an arctic coat from the
Arctic. During the evening a German sang,
and a gipsy danced a jig. The Orient, the
Arctic, the Tropics, and the Levant contributed
to the decorations. The dances were on
a brussels carpet direct from Brussels, according
to the word of two doctors of divinity who
sat near six masters of art. The titled gentlemen
laughed until they shook down a bowl of
paris green, and a shelf containing chinaware.
The Government (or Nation or Union, meaning
the United States) was honored by Alexis,
grand duke and envoy extraordinary, who presented
every senator and every judge a morocco
badge&mdash;two badges to the Chief Justice
of the highest court. A governor took umbrage,
but the Governor of California took native
claret; and as he sipped it an old greaser
with a nose of turkey-red color, who looked
like a ward politician from the Fourth Ward of
San Francisco, disgraced the South. Later a
breeze sprang from the east side of the Bay of
Fundy and cooled off the representative of the
empire of Germany greatly to the relief of
the German Empire itself. Every man present
hunted for his bowie-knife, except a
Methodist member of the Salvation Army, who<a class="pagenum" id="Page_40" title="40"></a>
quoted the Gospels, speaking often of God and
his Word, the Holy Writ. The Middle Ages
would have been disgraced if such italic head-lines
as our papers contained had ever disturbed
their quiet life. It was a wonderful
demonstration, even for a night of the nineteenth
century. Let us hope that foot-, side-,
and end-notes in small volumes of history may
tell the story to coming generations.&mdash;<cite>Maritime
World Code</cite>, January, 1899.</p>

<p><b>Scriptural Citations.</b> Scriptural citations
of chapter and verse should be thus: Chapter
in lower-case roman numerals, and verse in
figures, as: Acts vii, 16.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P41">41.</a> Compounds.</span> See also paragraphs <a href="#P10">10</a>
and <a href="#MISCELLANEOUS_27">27</a>. As stated in the introduction, the
<cite>Standard Dictionary</cite> seems to be the only one
that gives the compounding of words. By its
system both solidified and hyphenated words of
the compound type are shown. Teall’s book on
this subject is really a codification of the compounds
appearing in the <cite>Standard Dictionary</cite>.
Since Teall’s list was made there have been
some changes in the system preferred by good
writers. Every change has been in the direction
of solidifying. Teall gives bookkeeper as
one word, but make proof-reader two. He
makes postmaster one word, post-office a compound.
The Chicago Proofreaders’ Association
is more consistent in such cases, printing
all words of this type in the solidified form.</p>

<p>The following list is believed to be more
consistent than the Standard-Teall handling of
the same words, and is therefore preferred:</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P42">42.</a> Some Examples.</span> (a) Words denoting
an occupation or calling, as baggagemaster,
bagmaker, watchmaker, proofreader, bricklayer.</p>

<p>(b) Words denoting a connecting use, as<a class="pagenum" id="Page_43" title="43"></a>
barnyard, crosshead, carwheel, footboard, gaspipe.</p>

<p>(c) Words denoting a state of being, as
motherhood, fatherhood, widowhood.</p>

<p>(d) Words that are pronounced as one
word and usually printed as such, as claptrap,
crackerjack, daredevil, haphazard.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P43">43.</a> Approved Consolidations.</span> Words like
steamboat, railroad, fishline, firearms, pineapple,
catfish, bluebird, blackboard, quartermaster
are best as here printed. It is proper
to consolidate all words denoting a species,
kind or class of birds, animals or plants, as
kingfisher, meadowlark, bulldog, bloodhound,
wildcat, goldenseal.</p>

<p>(a) Anybody, anything, anywhere, evermore,
everybody, everything, everywhere, forevermore,
somewhere, nobody, something, nowhere,
nothing, afterpiece, crossexamine, crossquestion,
countermarch, antislavery, antedate,
schoolboy, schoolmate, schoolmistress, but
school teacher, school children and school
teaching.</p>

<p>(b) Other approved solidifications are
words denoting tools, materials, and implements,
as: Strawboard, halftone, guidebook,
screwdriver, rosewater, typewriter, handbook.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P44">44.</a> Compounds and Solids.</span> The following<a class="pagenum" id="Page_44" title="44"></a>

<p><span class="section"><a id="P45">45.</a> Interrupted Compounds.</span> Benjamin
Drew says, in <cite>Pens and Types:</cite> When two
words connected by a conjunction are severally
compound parts of a following word, the
hyphen is omitted, as:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We use cast and wrought iron pillars.</p>

<p>I have pruned my peach and apple trees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some authors follow the German style, inserting
the hyphens, thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We use cast- and wrought-iron pillars.</p>

<p>I have pruned my peach- and apple-trees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The style in the last example is known as the
<strong>interrupted compound</strong>. It is gaining ground
rapidly in the best printing-houses, and is recommended<a class="pagenum" id="Page_47" title="47"></a>
by De Vinne, who uses it in his books.
Here are some examples: Foot-, top-, and side-notes;
quarter-, eighth-, and half-kegs; base- and
foot-ball, foot- or side-note. This is good
usage. See the <cite>Century</cite> magazine for examples,
or see any books published by the Century
Company. There seems to be no other
way to signify that both words in such examples
are compounds.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P46">46.</a> No Fixed Rules.</span> There are no hard
and fast rules regarding compounds. It is,
in fact, almost impossible to hold to a uniform,
consistent style. Here are some of De Vinne’s
compoundings:</p>

<p>(a) Subject-matter, lower-case, making-up,
memorandum-book, proof-reader, fault-finding,
type-setting, style-card, letter-writing, printing-house,
quote-marks, quotation-marks,
piece-compositors, five-to-em body, book-making,
book-work, pre-historic, pre-raphaelite,
ill-bred, well-formed, good-looking, composing-room,
dining-table, canal-boat, ferry-house,
dwelling-house [See list on page 74 of De
Vinne’s <cite>Composition</cite>], over-wide, spelled-out,
title-page, table-work, old-style, bold-faced,
hymn-book, to-morrow, to-day, head-lines,
type-writing, catch-lines, hair-space, thin-space,
type-founders, side-heading, type-setting,
foot-note, letter-writer, side-notes, six-point,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_48" title="48"></a>
cut-in note, center-note, shoulder-note,
three-em indention, wide-leaded, double-leaded,
every-day world. Note that they do
not agree with the Chicago Proofreaders’ Association
list.</p>

<p>(b) The following are approved forms:
Fine-tooth saw, six-bit machine, six-foot pole,
two-year-old horse, but six-months-old baby.
Bluewing, whitefish, bricklayer, gaspipe, footboard,
motherhood, widowhood.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P47">47.</a> Specials.</span> The following list is for use
in trade-journals: Hopvine, hopyard, hop-picker,
labor-union, labor-saving, liquordealer,
liquorseller, liquor-saloon, liquor-store, liquor-bottle,
wine-merchant, wineroom, winedealer,
wine-taster, wine-press, wine-party, wine-vault,
wine-vinegar, wineglass, wineglassful, wine-stone,
vine-disease, trade-union, trade-mark,
trade-journal, trade-name, trade-wind, street-car,
street-railroad, street-sweeper, street-sprinkler,
street-walker, pastepot, paperknife,
papercutter, saloonmen, saloonkeeper, barkeeper,
barkeep, wood-alcohol.</p>

<p>(a) Many words that might be solidified,
under the rules of logic, are set with hyphens
because they present an unsightly appearance
as one word. These things are largely matters
of fancy.</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_49" title="49"></a>

<p>(b) There are some such expressions as,
<strong>Italian and Chinese American citizens</strong>, which
are very puzzling. The question arises whether
hyphens should be used in such expressions,
and how. Such sentences are sometimes erroneously
written with one hyphen, as, <strong>Italian and
Chinese-American citizens</strong>. The sentence is
proper enough as first written, but a somewhat
more discriminating use would be, <strong>Italian- and
Chinese-American citizens</strong>. In expressions like
these the interrupted compounds are properly
written with hyphens. See paragraph <a href="#P45">45</a>.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P48">48.</a> Dashes.</span> Avoid dashes in side-headings,
as in this <cite>Style-code</cite>. They are not needed at
the end of a quotation, between it and the
credit. See paragraph <a href="#P22">22</a>.</p>

<p>Also see De Vinne’s <cite>Correct Composition</cite>,
page 273.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P49">49.</a> De Vinne Rules Violated.</span> Though the
Century Company, the <cite>Century Magazine</cite>, and
editors high in authority follow the simple
rules laid down by De Vinne, there are many
violations of these rules in the <cite>Century</cite> itself,
as well as in its publications. Sometimes
names of newspapers are quoted, and sometimes
they are set in italic. The system of
capitals is not closely followed. In a letter to
the editor of this work, Mr. De Vinne thus explained
the failure of the publications of the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_50" title="50"></a>
Century Company to show uniformity: “The
Century Company has many editors, and each
editor has notions of his own that printers are
directed to follow. Though most of these editors
abide by the rules expounded by me in my
works on typography, a study of some of our
books shows that the neglect to capitalize Bay,
City, Island, etc., when the word refers distinctly
to a proper name, is a common error&mdash;so
common that the proofreaders find it a
waste of time to suggest to editors and authors
the need of a capital. Yet I hold stoutly to the
correctness of the capital. Even careful editors
are often overruled by authors. The Century
printing-house can not be held responsible,
with justice, for some of the eccentricities
of our printing. It should be borne in
mind that a printer’s business is to do what
he is told.”</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P50">50.</a> Division of Words.</span> De Vinne says the
system most approved now authorizes the division
of a word, when consistent with pronunciation,
on the vowel at the end of the syllable.
The system is defective in its inability to
make provision for the syllables that end with
consonants. Divisions of all kinds should be
prevented as often as possible. The Chicago
Proofreaders’ Association offers the following<a class="pagenum" id="Page_51" title="51"></a>
rules concerning divisions. The reprint ‘follows
copy’ as published by the Association:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The proper division of words is an important
matter. An improper division is as much an
error as a misplaced letter, and is oftentimes
more misleading.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Follow the American rule of dividing words
at the end of the line according to pronunciation
rather than the British rule of dividing on
the vowel or to show derivation. The dictionary
in use in any particular office should be
followed, unless otherwise directed.</p>

<p>Where a vowel constitutes a syllable in the
middle of a word, place this vowel in the first
line, as promi-nent is preferable to prom-inent,
quali-ties to qual-ities, particu-lar to partic-ular,
dili-gence to dil-igence, sepa-rate to sep-arate,
etc. Exceptions: In words ending in
-able or -ible, the single vowel should be carried
into the second line.</p>

<p>There are frequent instances where a particular
division of a word will aid the reader in
its pronunciation at first sight, obviating a
faltering or repetition, as pro-gress, verb, and
prog-ress, noun; distrib-ute, verb, and distri-bution,
noun; pre-fer, verb, and pref-erable,
adjective.</p>

<p>Never divide a word pronounced as one syllable,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_52" title="52"></a>
as “changed,” “drowned,” “dipped,”
etc.</p>

<p>Avoid all two-letter divisions except in very
narrow measures or where very large types are
used.</p>

<p>Avoid having three or more successive divisions
at the ends of lines.</p>

<p>Divide En-gland and En-glish as pronounced
and as they are here printed.</p>

<p>The addition of s to form the plural of a
word&mdash;as horses, fences, etc.&mdash;does not justify
a division on the last portion so formed, as, circumstan-ces,
etc. Avoid all such divisions.</p>




<h2 id="EDITORIAL_OBSERVATIONS_51">51. EDITORIAL OBSERVATIONS.</h2>

<p><a id="P51_1">(1)</a> <b>Employee</b> is a good English word.
Avoid employe whenever possible to do so.</p>

<p><a id="P51_2">(2)</a> <b>Headquarters</b> is usually plural, sometimes
singular.</p>

<p><a id="P51_3">(3)</a> <b>Last held</b> meeting. <strong>Held</strong> is useless.
Newcomer and Teall oppose such expressions.</p>

<p><a id="P51_4">(4)</a> <b>Etc.</b> It is a common error to write

always <strong>et al.</strong></p>

<p><a id="P51_6">(6)</a> <b>Follows, as follows.</b> As follows is always

<p><a id="P51_7">(7)</a> <b>Plurals.</b> These are preferred plurals:
Cannon, craft for vessels, heathen, fowl,

<p><a id="P51_11">(11)</a> <b>On yesterday, on Sunday.</b> On is usually
superfluous, except in some sentences,
where euphony or emphasis may make the <strong>on</strong>
seem an element of strength.</p>

<p><a id="P51_12">(12)</a> <b>Welsh rarebit.</b> Welsh <strong>rabbit</strong> is the
correct expression. The use of rarebit in this

<p><b><a id="P52">52.</a> Books</b>, papers, plays, operas, and periodicals
should be cited in italic, as: Bowie’s <cite>Tenting
On Coral Strands</cite>, the <cite>Sun</cite>, <cite>Lucia</cite>, <cite>Mascot</cite>,
the <cite>Century</cite>. De Vinne notices an irregularity in
the style of setting credits. However, bibliographers
prefer italic; but printers (on account
of the saving of labor), select quote-marks. If
the name of the play and that of the character
are the same, as <cite>Ingomar</cite>, the name of the
play must be quoted, the character italicized.
See De Vinne’s <cite>Correct Composition</cite>, page 224.
See also paragraphs <a href="#P22">22</a>, <a href="#P39">39</a>.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P53">53.</a> Ships and Vessels.</span> There is not any
need to either quote or italicize the names of
vessels, unless there would be doubt as to what
the name means. In such cases italics are preferred,
though quoting the name will do.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P54">54.</a> Newspapers and Magazines.</span> Names of
newspapers and magazines should be set in
italic. Some papers and magazines quote magazines<a class="pagenum" id="Page_55" title="55"></a>
and italicize newspapers. Italics are better
in both cases. De Vinne runs both in roman.
The name of one’s own paper is run in small
capitals. Linotype machines have upset these
rules somewhat, but unwisely so in careful
work.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P55">55.</a> Farther.</span> Use farther for distance.
Further is used in the sense of besides, moreover,
being equivalent to additional. “I have
gone further in astronomy, you have traveled
farther in miles.”</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P56">56.</a> Foreign Words and Phrases.</span> All foreign
words and phrases that have not been
Englished by long use should be italicized. Vice
versa, en route, pro tem, and like words should
go in roman. Aid-de-camp, addenda, ad valorem,
alias, alibi, alma mater, anno Domini,
ante bellum, a propos, billet doux, bona fide,
bravos, cafe, cantos, carte blanche, viva voce,
rendezvous, ultimatum, post-mortem, per cent.,
per capita, per annum, facsimile, and about
fifty like words go under the same rule.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P57">57.</a> Unfamiliar Words.</span> Unfamiliar words
are run in italic the first time, but in roman
thereafter, as: <i>Aloha</i>, <i>renigging</i>, <i>mulching</i>. But
see paragraph <a href="#P68">68</a>.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P58">58.</a> Plays.</span> <cite>Julius Caesar</cite> should be set in
italic when it refers to the character in Shakespeare’s<a class="pagenum" id="Page_56" title="56"></a>
play, but the name Julius Caesar for
the man. The play itself should be “Julius
Caesar,” or <cite>Julius Caesar</cite>. See paragraph <a href="#P52">52</a>.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P59">59.</a> Salutations.</span> Under the old way salutations
such as <i>Dear Sir:</i> were put in italics
with the colon as indicated. Dear Sir: as here
written is just as proper. Take your choice
and you will not err. The dash is not needed.
It is well to let <strong>Dear Sir:</strong> occupy a line by itself,
properly indented.</p>

<p>De Vinne says he never writes such salutations
as Dear Sir in italic though he admits
that italic with a colon and no dash is the
commonly accepted form. He advises roman
lower-case.</p>

<p><span class="section"><a id="P60">60.</a> Salutations and Indentions.</span> Salutations
should be set in ordinary roman, with
hanging indention, thus:</p>

<p class="hang">The Writers’ and Proofreaders’ Society for the
Prevention of Burial in the Potter’s Field,
216 Goodfellows street. Office of the Secretary,
37 New Testament House, New Orleans,
January 1, 1908.</p>

<p class="hang">To the Superintendent of the Home for the
Unfortunate Dead.</p>

<p class="nohang"><i>Dear Sir:</i></p>

<p class="indent">In reply to your request for a list of our
members, etc. The signature should be set in<a class="pagenum" id="Page_57" title="57"></a>
small capital letters. See De Vinne’s <cite>Correct
Composition</cite>, page 168.</p>

<p><span class="section"><a id="P61">61.</a> Punctuation.</span> The Chicago Proofreaders’
Association has these rules:</p>

<p>Omit periods after per cent, and after roman
numerals when used strictly as figures, but not
when used in names, as Napoleon III.</p>

<p>Use em dash in conversations such as this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. Smith&mdash;Is your task completed?</p>

<p>Mr. Brown&mdash;Nearly.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P62">62.</a> Punctuation with Parentheses.</span> The
comma should usually go after the last parenthesis;
it is seldom needed before the first
one. De Vinne says: “When any complete
sentence is enclosed by parentheses, the period
should be before the last parenthesis, but when
these parentheses enclose a few words at the
end of a sentence, the period should be after
the last parenthesis.”</p>


<p><b><a id="P63">63.</a> Medieval</b> and such words are spelled
the simplest way. See the <cite>Standard Dictionary</cite>.
Subpena, diarrhea, Etna Company.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P64">64.</a> O, Oh, Oh!</span> These expressions are punctuated
thus: O for a South Sea home! O that
I had insured in the Etna! Oh, how my tooth
aches! Oh! my crimes are deep and dark.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P65">65.</a> Plural of Proper Names.</span> It is a common
newspaper error to run sentences like this,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_58" title="58"></a>
from the social columns of the San Francisco
<cite>Examiner</cite> of July 15, 1906: “The Thomas H.
Williams have been visiting the City.” The attempt
to make the singular do the duty of the
plural in such a case is ridiculous. Williamses
is the plural of Williams. Printers and writers
should learn how to write the plural of proper
names.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P66">66.</a> Quote-marks.</span> It is sometimes a puzzle
where to place quote-marks. There is no better
rule than that stated by De Vinne, who says
that the closing marks of quotation always
should be placed after the comma or the period
in all places where these marks are needed;
but the fact is the proper place of the closing
marks of quotation should be determined by
the quoted words only; they must inclose those
words, and no more; they may be before or
after the points, according to the construction
of the sentence. When the quotation makes a
complete sentence, put the quotation-marks
after the period at the end of that sentence;
when the quotation is at the end of but a portion
of this sentence which terminates with a
colon, semicolon, or any other point, then put
the marks before the point. The mark of
punctuation intended to define the construction
of the completed sentence should not be made a
portion of the fragmentary quoted matter.</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_59" title="59"></a>

<p>A fine example of this is seen in the following:
He asked, “Who said my mother lied?”
and didn’t Jones reply, “Nobody dared to say
that”?</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P67">67.</a> Smaller Type.</span> Quote-marks are not
needed when extracts or quotations are set in
smaller type than the body of the book or
paper. Some reputable publications do not
quote the extracts, even when they are set in
the regular type of the publication and run in
separate paragraphs. The indenting of the
matter one em at the beginning and one em at
the end of a line suffices. Such matter should
be set solid when the main text is leaded.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P68">68.</a> Quote-marks, single.</span> When especial
attention is called to a word the single quote-marks
are used in lieu of the old way of double
quotes or italic. Thus: He said he thought
the word ‘grafting’ applied to politics, not to
horticulture. See De Vinne’s <cite>Correct Composition</cite>,
page 213, where authors are advised to
make one such emphasis of a word suffice, because
repetition irritates the reader.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P69">69.</a> Reverend and the reverend.</span> Never
say Reverend John Brown. It must always be
the Reverend John Brown, for reverend is not
a title to be used like captain or doctor. Honorable
should be used in the same way, if at all.</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_60" title="60"></a>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P70">70.</a> Saviour and savior.</span> Preserve the historic
way of spelling the Saviour when Jesus
Christ is meant. Other saviors are without
the <em>u</em>.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P71">71.</a> Specials.</span> Print birdsnest, birdseye,
bullseye, heartsease (a plant or flower), calvesfoot
and neatsfoot as single words, without
apostrophe or hyphen, except when signifying
the actual nest of a bird, the eye of a bird or of
a bull, etc.</p>

<p><span class="section"><a id="P73">73.</a> United States are or United States Is.</span>
If the expression is used as a collective term,
designating one great nation, the singular is
correct, but there are many sentences in which
the plural verb must be used. It is proper to
follow copy or query the expression, if there
is doubt as to its correctness.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P74">74.</a> Verbs, singular or plural.</span> There should
be no hesitation in using the singular form of a
verb when the subject has a singular meaning.
Sometimes the logical subject is singular, the
grammatical plural, as in, <strong>Ten dollars was paid.</strong>
By ellipsis, <strong>the sum of</strong> is understood.</p>

<p><a id="P74_a">(a)</a> <b>Addition.</b> Shall we say “two and two
is four?” Professor William Dwight Whitney
decided for the <cite>Century Dictionary</cite> (of which
he was one of the editors), that <strong>two and two is
four</strong>, because the full meaning is <strong>the sum of</strong>
two and two, or something “<strong>similarly unifying</strong>
in the sense of two and two.”</p>

<p><a id="P74_b">(b)</a> The singular verb should be used when
the subject is plural in form, though it represents
a number of things to be taken together
as forming a unit. Here is an example: Thirty-four
years <strong>affects</strong> one’s remembrance of some
circumstances. <cite>De Quincey.</cite></p>

<p><a id="P74_c">(c)</a> The singular verb is to be used with
<strong>book titles</strong> and <strong>similar names and singulars</strong><a class="pagenum" id="Page_62" title="62"></a>
that are plural in form but logically a unit.
See Baskervill and Sewell’s <cite>English Grammar</cite>,
pages 312, 313. An example from Goldsmith is:
“The Three Pigeons expects me down every
moment.” So, we should say the Odd Fellows
meets to-night, meaning, by ellipsis, the lodge
of Odd Fellows.</p>

<p><a id="P74_d">(d)</a> Companies, associations, etc., are usually
singular in meaning, as: The Southern
Pacific Company <strong>is</strong> in trouble, the Bar Association
<strong>is</strong> incorporated. However, collective nouns
are to be followed by a plural verb when the
individuals are thought of separately, as: A
multitude <strong>go</strong> mad about it. <cite>Emerson.</cite> All our
household <strong>are</strong> at rest. <cite>Coleridge.</cite></p>

<p><a id="P74_e">(e)</a> The following is from Teall: Three dollars
<strong>was</strong> paid, ten dollars <strong>was</strong> the price. When
the meaning is simply a sum of money as one
sum, and not so many actual separate dollars,
the verb should be singular. Though the verb
should be singular, this is so under the rules of
logic, rather than those of grammar. In literal
strictness it would not be ungrammatical to say
ten dollars <strong>were</strong> paid.</p>

<p><a id="P74_f">(f)</a> Collective nouns are always singular in
form, but many of them, if not most, may be
used even in that form with a plural verb, but
such use depends upon the nature of the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_63" title="63"></a>
thought to be expressed. Considered as really
singular are a <strong>crowd</strong>, an <strong>army</strong>, a <strong>multitude</strong>. It
should be remembered that these words also
have regular plural forms, though often used
with the plural verb in the collective form.</p>

<p><a id="P74_g">(g)</a> All words like ethics, mathematics,
physics, and politics are plural in form, but
they are usually treated as singular in meaning.
The dictionary definitions of such words
all begin, “the science which treats,” etc.
James Russell Lowell wrote politics <em>are</em>, and
this has been held sufficient justification for
this use. <cite>Teall.</cite></p>

<p><a id="P74_h">(h)</a> Either <strong>bricks</strong> or <strong>brick</strong> is proper as a
plural. <strong>Brick</strong> probably has the better standing.
The <cite>Century Dictionary</cite> says <strong>brick</strong> is the
proper singular collective.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P75">75.</a> Whereabouts.</span> Whereabouts <strong>is</strong>, which is
never <strong>are</strong>, is often written with the plural verb,
but it should not be considered a plural. The
error doubtless occurs from some fancied resemblance
to <strong>headquarters</strong>, which may be
either singular or plural.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P76">76.</a> Women.</span> Women’s names should never
be preceded by their husbands’ titles, as: Mrs.
Governor Pardee, Mrs. General John Jones,
Mrs. Doctor Charles Ketchum.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P77">77.</a> Variations.</span> In many of the job offices<a class="pagenum" id="Page_64" title="64"></a>
of the country, also in newspaper offices where
composition is done by the linotype, there will
be many variations from the style expounded
in this little manual. For example, it will not
be practical to follow the italic citations of
books, magazines, newspapers, etc., in offices
where the equipment does not contain italic
magazines. In such cases the use of roman is
recommended, without quote-marks, which are
unnecessary and unsightly. If the equipment
does not carry small capitals, newspapers
should run their own names in roman, making
no distinction between their own and other
publications.</p>

<p>When there is no italic, it may be well to
quote the names of books and plays, also the
names of vessels and characters in novels,
plays, etc. This should not be the custom with
vessels and characters, except when it is necessary
to indicate that a vessel or a character,
rather than a person, is meant.</p>

<p>Offices not able to carry out the code as set
forth in detail in these pages, should make
notes of deviations, abiding by such portions
of the code as their equipments make possible.
By a few interlineations, notations, etc., or by
an office card of deviations this work will be
made useful even where it is not followed to
the letter.</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_65" title="65"></a>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P78">78.</a> Wave-lines, etc.</span> The custom is almost
too well known to record that one line under
a word or words means that the underscored
matter is to be set in italics, that two lines
mean small capitals, and that three signify
capitals. Similarly, a wave-line under a word
or words means that the portions of the manuscript
thus underscored are to be set in lower-case
bold-faced type. Two wave-lines under
matter mean that it is to be set in bold-faced
capitals. A single line down the left side of
matter means that it is to be set in type smaller
than the body of the article, and two lines indicate
that the matter is to be set in type of still
smaller face.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P79">79.</a> Writers’ Absurdities.</span> Book-offices have
their own intricacies of style, with the additional
bother of having to suit the varying
whims of authors and publishers. “Many men
of many minds” write for the papers, but their
various whims need not be humored as those
of book-writers need be. Authors of books
frequently insist upon having things their own
way, and too often the printers have to make
that way for them, in opposition to what the
authors write. This is certainly something for
which the authors should be made to pay. If
an author is determined to have certain matters
of style conform to a certain set of whims, or<a class="pagenum" id="Page_66" title="66"></a>
even of good, logical opinions, he should write
accordingly, or pay extra for the necessary
changes. <cite>Teall.</cite></p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P80">80.</a> Work of Stenographers.</span> If stenographers
would master the principles of the system explained
herein they would increase their efficiency.
As conducted nowadays there is great
lack of system in the work turned out by
stenographers and others who use typewriting
machines.</p>

<p>Though many of the principles and rules
herein set forth are with reference to the work
of printing-houses, the fact remains that the
principles that make for good printing make
also for good composition in general. The De
Vinne system should be mastered by typewriters,
and used by them on all work that is
left to their own judgment.</p>


<p><span class="section"><a id="P81">81.</a> Words Spelled Anew.</span> There has been
considerable recent (September, 1906) discussion
of the reformed spelling as recommended
by the Simplified Spelling Board, of New York
City. The list has been recommended by
eminent scholars of both Europe and America,
and many of the words have been in general
use for many years. In adopting the list recently,
President Roosevelt said: “It is not an
attack on the language of Shakespeare and<a class="pagenum" id="Page_67" title="67"></a>
Milton, because it is in some instances a going
back to the forms they used, and in others
merely the extension of changes which, as regards
other words, have taken place since their
time. It is not an attempt to do anything far-reaching
or sudden or violent, or, indeed, anything
very great at all. It is merely an attempt
to cast what slight weight can properly be cast
on the side of the popular forces which are
endeavoring to make our spelling a little less
foolish and fantastic.”</p>

<h2 id="FORMS_OF_ADDRESS_83">83. FORMS OF ADDRESS.</h2>


<p>The following correct forms of address are believed
to conform to the recognized custom, as indorsed by
official, social, and scholarly sources of authority.
Most of the examples are from Westlake’s “How to
Write Letters,” but some are from Harper’s Cyclopedia:</p>

<p><b>Army Officers.</b> See <a href="#Military_and_Naval">Military</a>, <a href="#Colonel">Colonel</a>, etc.</p>

<p><b>Associate Justice</b> of the Supreme Court of the United
States, or of the supreme court of any state. To Honorable
John Brown, justice. Sir:</p>

<p><b>Assistant Secretaries</b> of Federal departments, heads
of bureaus, etc. To John Brown, Esq., secretary of
state. Sir:</p>

<p><b>Bishop.</b> Except in the case of Methodists address
a bishop as the Right Reverend John Brown. Salutation&mdash;Right
Reverend Sir: or Right Reverend and
Dear Sir:</p>

<p><b>Board of Education, Board of Trade, etc.</b> To the
President and Members of the &mdash;&mdash;. Sirs: or Honorable
Sirs: or May it Please Your Honorable Body.
Other organizations of similar character are addressed
after this style.</p>

<p><b>Cabinet Members.</b> To the Honorable E.&nbsp;M. Stanton,
secretary of war. Another form is Honorable E.&nbsp;M.
Stanton. The salutation is simply Sir:</p>

<p><b>Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.</b> To the Honorable
Joseph McKenna, chief justice of the Supreme
Court, or To the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
Sir: or Mr. Chief Justice:</p>

<p><b>College Presidents.</b> Either Dear Sir: or Reverend
and Dear Sir: as the case may be.</p>

<p><b>Company, President of.</b> John Jones, president of the
North German Cracker Company. Sir: or Dear Sir:</p>

<p><b>Court or Judge.</b> Honorable Thomas F. Graham,
judge of the Superior Court. Sir: Dear Sir: or Your
Honor:</p>

<p><b><a id="Colonel">Colonel</a>.</b> Colonel John Brown, commanding the
First Cavalry. Or Colonel John Brown, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A.
Colonel:</p>

<p><b><a id="Doctors">Doctors</a>.</b> Women doctors may be addressed as Doctor
Mary Walker, or as Mary Walker, M.&nbsp;D. See <a href="#Physicians_and_Surgeons">physicians</a>.</p>

<p><b>Dentists.</b> Doctor John Brown. Sir: or Dear Sir:</p>

<p><b>Excellency.</b> Excellency, Your Excellency, His Excellency,
etc., were formerly applied to the President,
but now such use is wrong. Foreign ministers and
governors are addressed as Excellency.</p>

<p><b>General.</b> General John Brown, commanding the
armies of the U.&nbsp;S. General: or Sir: The former is
preferred.</p>

<a class="pagenum" id="Page_74" title="74"></a>

etc.</b> Honorable John Brown, Attorney General,
etc. Sir:</p>

<p><b>House of Representatives.</b> To the Honorable the
Speaker of the House of Representatives. Sir: or Mr.
Speaker:</p>

<p><b>Honorable.</b> This title is applicable to judges, mayors,
senators, representatives in Congress, the heads

<p><b>Mr. and Esq.</b> These terms are somewhat interchangeable
in America, but an ignorant man should
not be addressed as Esq. It is proper to confine the
title to persons of refinement.</p>

<p><b>My Dear Sir.</b> This implies closer friendship than
Dear Sir.</p>

<p><b>Miss.</b> Miss Clara Barton. Dear Madam: or Dear
Miss: or Miss Barton:</p>

<p><b>Mrs.</b> May be used, contrary to views expressed elsewhere
in this volume, before such titles as Mrs. General
Sheridan, Mrs. Admiral Porter. This custom has
the sanction of good usage at the National Capital,
though critics condemn it.</p>

Smith. Address her as Mrs. Erastus Smith if Erastus
is her husband’s name.</p>

<p><b>Mr.</b> Mr. is sometimes used before such titles as
President, Chief Justice, Attorney General, etc.</p>

<p><b><a id="Military_and_Naval">Military and Naval</a>.</b> Those who rank under captain
in the Army, and commodore in the Navy, are addressed
as Mr., Sir, or Dr., with U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;N. or U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A.
after their names.</p>

<p><b><a id="Physicians_and_Surgeons">Physicians and Surgeons</a>.</b> Doctor John Brown.

etc.</b> To John Brown, Esq., President of &mdash;&mdash;.

Washington, D.&nbsp;C. Salutation is Sir: or Mr. President:

courtesy to men of just scholarship. The title should
